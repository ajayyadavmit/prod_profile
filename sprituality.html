    <h1>Spirituality and Religion</h1>
    <p>Spirituality is to reach nearby Truth Knowledge. There is not any boundary like do and don't checklist in
      Spirituality alike in Religion. Religion has a task checklist ( karmakanda) to perform and to get to know the
      inner self.
      There are several gods and goddesses and you should choose those God / Goddesses that match your
      self-consciousness. God and Goddess will help you to reach consciousness and find out the truth.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>Kali Mata - Black ( The Devil ) Infinity
    </h3>
    <p>Kali is the Goddess of Destruction and Death. Destruction is just one phase to Construct new things that are good
      for society and human beings. Death is just an End to the physical Body so that soul takes another body to start
      fresh life. Karma will help them to choose their next life. Wherever there is destruction, you see the Black Color
      as being a collective force of energy.
      Universe is represented in the Black color and any life there has different colors like stars, sun, earth etc..
      Kali Mata represents the full universe, not only the Earth planet.</p>
    <h3>Kali Mata Yantra
    </h3>
    <p>Yantra is an instrument that helps to reach Sat-Chit-Anand (Truth-Consciousness/ Pure awareness- Happiness/ Joy).
      These capacities are stored inside human beings. However, they need to put an effort to find out
      Truth-Consciousness-Joy inside you.
      Kali Mata Yantra will guide you at the initial phase to find T-C-J.
      The outer four rectangle lines in a yantra represent the Fire (temperature), Earth(solid), Space (Area), and
      Water. By these four elements, the human physical body is constructed and after death the human body will be part
      of those four entities.
      The innermost dot at yantra is to find the pure awareness within yourself. Those between outer and inner elements
      are just a traversal element that help to reach at Conscious level.
      All things are accepted towards Kali. Kali is Universal so there is nothing any physical entity that is not
      accepted by Kali Mata. The only significance is you need to perform a task in a specific process for anything
      offered to Goddess.</p>

    <h3>Devil Era has started - AI Technology Boom
    </h3>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are part of the Kali age. There will be tremendous increase in the AI Models
      within the 10 years time frame. AI will be present ubiquitously. There won't be any field or domain where AI
      technologies will be absent.
      Slowly AI technologies will control human beings in all aspects whether their human fundamental function of life -
      birth, adult, old, death or any material aspects.
      These AI technologies give a short temper easiness to society. However in the long run, these technologies will
      destroy human civilization and society structures.
