    <h3>Data to Knowledge Management</h3>
    <p> Understanding data helps to find out the hidden information and knowledge that help to maximize operational
      efficiency, understand your own mindset and predicting others behaviors. Thus students should learn about various
      data types and the process of extracting information from data. Even data is the primary source to make machines
      intelligent. The data, information, knowledge, wisdom (DIKW) pyramid model explains about different levels of data
      (Weje, 2018; Khera, 2023).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data is an unorganized form of numbers or characters in a raw fact. Raw data does not provide any meaning
        without context such as this number does not have any meaning 20230112. AI tools can be used to process data for
        understanding meaning at some context level.
      </li>
      <li>Information is structured data having a contextual meaning such as this number 20230112 has the contextual
        meaning 12th of January 2023. AI tools can be used to analyze information from several sources of data.
      </li>
      <li>Knowledge gives an answer related to the “how” question from the context information. As of now, only the
        human mind would be able to provide the knowledge; AI tools and machines function as a support system to analyze
        the big data for the knowledge building process. Knowledge can be built only through experience and it takes
        enough time to construct knowledge. One of the biggest hurdles for knowledge building is that people don't want
        to share knowledge, since they may need to share about failure and choices that signifies why a particular
        decision was taken? According to KnowledgeMT, there is no strict way to extract knowledge from an experienced
        person and note in a document so that anyone by reading those documents can become an expert, due to which
        universities had never produced experienced managers (KnowledgeMT, 2017, 1:23). However, through DIK pyramid
        organization can support a knowledge building system. Often, knowledge is built upon experimenting things and
        failure is seen as part of the learning culture for the knowledge building process. Failure helps to refine the
        knowledge. As per Ted talk presented by Kondal Reddy (2018), 90% of innovation in global corporations happened
        through informal knowledge sharing rather than formal meeting discussion. It is very critical to have a
        knowledge building system in organization since several technological products have become obsolete in recent
        decades due to innovation in new products. Sharing the knowledge helps to build the innovative products over
        time (TEDx Talks, 2018, 8:38). Students in the digital era should be focused on data and information sharing to
        have collaborative discussions that help to gain experience and build the knowledge over time in the academic
        year.</li>
      <li>Wisdom is the Truth nature. </li>
      <li>Wisdom is the applied action from choices of several knowledge, information, and data at the right time, and
        right place. Wisdom is at the conscious level of an individual with deep understanding on the subject. It gives
        decision making choices about why something was chosen as the best choice. Only the human mind would act at the
        wisdom level, today students need to be taught about wisdom. Although AI tools and machines perform several
        tasks in todays innovative era, wisdom will always be great assets for human mankind. Wisdom is known at the
        context level. The choice of a particular decision in a given context is influenced by individual wisdom. The
        same problem would have different decisions outcomes as per individual wisdom due to environment context. Wisdom
        cannot be directly taught to students, however wisdom examples can be mentioned in descriptive case study
        decisions made by leaders.
      </li>
      <li>data and information present details about past activity. However, knowledge and wisdom are associated with
        the present and future moment that helps to know; what action should be taken now and in future</li>
      <li>AI tools can be there for data, information and some how knowledge generation</li>
      <li>But Human Minds and judgement will be there always for Wisdom</li>
      <li>Future of Education need to focus at Wisdom and Truth level</li>
