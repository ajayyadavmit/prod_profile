          <p>Explore the Computer Science curriculum that covers programming, AI, and more. Our curriculum is designed
            to provide a deep understanding of 21st-century skills.</p> <br>
          <p>The research findings from CS teachers, students, and several literature review articles, I am suggesting
            the required attributes for the CS curriculum. The CS curriculum should focus on computational thinking.
            Computation thinking can be taught with several interdisciplinary subject examples. Grade 10 students should
            know about programming in both block-based and text-based. Block-based programs can be used to support slow
            learners or to understand concepts. Proficiency in text- based programming is an actual coding skill.
            Debugging is a valuable skill that would help students to explore and fix problems in programming. The words
            in the textbook should be analyzed through a flesch reading score that help to judge the student's
            understandable contents in the textbook. Since the world is advancing towards AI and ML, thus data plays a
            valuable role in future CS technologies. Students should know the value of data and how machines behaves
            intelligence through learning from data. Graphics play a central role as the user interface's front end.
            Graphics contents should be focussed at secondary school level. Learning should be fun, interactive and game
            based through constructive projects. The ingredients for the CS curriculum is mentioned in figure 8.</p>

          <p>The CS curriculum should be student-centric since students are the targeted audience for curriculum.
            Curriculum should be value oriented towards student life and career development. Curriculum should help
            students to expand knowledge and explore new learning resources in digital platforms. New generation
            students are the most-affected by the technologies development in their lifestyle. Thus technologies
            friendly curriculum would help students to utmost utilize technologies to support their life activities.
            Alumni students feedback should be taken for the revision of curriculum so that they know what value most as
            part of the CS curriculum. For the curriculum development, it is proposed to include the alumni students in
            the committee as depicted in figure 5.
