        <h4><i style="color: rgb(101, 29, 225);">This Model is a guide map tool for developing the Student-Centric
            Computer Science curriculum at
            Secondary School Level (grades 9 to 12).
          </i></h4>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computational thinking is the core source of Computer Science discipline. The objective
          of computational
          thinking is to solve problems in an algorithmic way. Computation thinking is required to be taught in an
          unplugged programming way which does not require a physical Computer device.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Computer Science is a technological advancement subject, thus the curriculum is required
          to include
          examples from interdisciplinary horizontal and vertical subjects. The Flesch-Kincaid readability tool helps to
          judge the language of a textbook as per grade standard. The curriculum designers can use several readability
          tools within their social context that help to standardize the textbook as per student ability.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The learning should be exploratory based on student individual interest ability. The
          student interested in
          drawing arts can choose graphics areas, and block based programming to explore CS concepts. Similarly,
          students interested in Mathematics and problem solving can explore the text-based Programming areas. The
          students interested in content creations can explore data areas. Artificial Intelligence tools are widely used
          that consume the data generated by users. Various AI models are used to solve the problem specific tasks.

    <h3>Curriculum Balance Approach for Globalized and Localized Contents
    </h3>
    <p>&nbsp; The balanced curriculum includes both localized and gobalized learning resources. The balanced curriculum
      includes both localized and globalized learning resources. Localized learning resources help students to
      understand and implement concepts in a practical way with the facility of adequate resources in their areas.
      The globalized learning resources will help to standardize the curriculum standard across the globe that promotes
      innovation and knowledge sharing.</p>

    <h4>Curiculum Weightage for Localized and Globalized Contents </h4>
    <p>This weightage would help to structure the CS curriculum by including both localized and globalized learning
      resources. The localized learning resources decrease with the upper grade's and proportionately increase the
      globalized learning resources.
    </p>

    <p>Note: 15% weightage value to each Arrow</p>

      <h3>Educational Theories for Computer Science curriculum</h3>
      <p>Behaviorism learning theory is related to memorization and understanding of theoretical contents. Behaviorism
        focuses on reinforcement learning with reward and punishment. Cognitivism is focussed on how well teachers can
        make students understand CS contents. Constructivism is focussed on students how they construct knowledge from CS
        curriculum and explore more on learning resources. Connectivism theory is related to student participation in
        blogs, forums and online learning platforms that help to explore learning and work in a team in the real-world.
