        <h4><i>This Model is a guide map tool for developing the Student-Centric Computer Science curriculum at
            Secondary School Level (grades 9 to 12).
          </i></h4>
        <p > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computational thinking is the core source of Computer Science discipline. The objective of computational
          thinking is to solve problems in an algorithmic way. Computation thinking is required to be taught in an
          unplugged programming way which does not require a physical Computer device.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Computer Science is a technological advancement subject, thus the curriculum is required to include
          examples from interdisciplinary horizontal and vertical subjects. The Flesch-Kincaid readability tool helps to
          judge the language of a textbook as per grade standard. The curriculum designers can use several readability
          tools within their social context that help to standardize the textbook as per student ability.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The learning should be exploratory based on student individual interest ability. The student interested in
          drawing arts can choose graphics areas, and block based programming to explore CS concepts. Similarly,
          students interested in Mathematics and problem solving can explore the text-based Programming areas. The
          students interested in content creations can explore data areas. Artificial Intelligence tools are widely used
          that consume the data generated by users. Various AI models are used to solve the problem specific tasks.

          <p>The CS curriculum should be student-centric since students are the targeted audience for curriculum.
            Curriculum should be value oriented towards student life and career development. Curriculum should help
            students to expand knowledge and explore new learning resources in digital platforms. New generation
            students are the most-affected by the technologies development in their lifestyle. Thus technologies
            friendly curriculum would help students to utmost utilize technologies to support their life activities.
            Alumni students feedback should be taken for the revision of curriculum so that they know what value most as
            part of the CS curriculum. For the curriculum development, it is proposed to include the alumni students in
            the committee as depicted in figure 5.
